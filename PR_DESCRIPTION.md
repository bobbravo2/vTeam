# ðŸ”§ BUGFIX: Fix Operator Backend Service Connection Error

## Problem

AgenticSession executions were failing in local development with the error:
```
Cannot connect to host backend-service.vteam-dev.svc.cluster.local:8080 ssl:default [Name or service not known]
```

This prevented the operator from updating session status and completing workflows properly.

## Root Cause

The operator was hardcoded to create claude-runner jobs with `BACKEND_API_URL=http://backend-service.vteam-dev.svc.cluster.local:8080/api`, but local development environment uses the service name `vteam-backend`.

## Solution

1. **Service Alias**: Created `backend-service-alias.yaml` ExternalName service that maps `backend-service` â†’ `vteam-backend`
2. **Environment Configuration**: Added proper `BACKEND_API_URL` environment variable to operator deployment
3. **Integration**: Added service alias to automatic deployment flow in `crc-start.sh`

## Testing

- âœ… **Before Fix**: AgenticSession jobs failed with backend connection errors
- âœ… **After Fix**: AgenticSession workflows complete successfully 
- âœ… **Regression Testing**: All 24/24 tests still passing
- âœ… **End-to-End Verification**: Created test sessions that properly connect to backend and update status

## Impact

- ðŸŽ¯ **AgenticSession workflows now fully functional** in local development
- ðŸ”§ **No manual intervention required** - fix deploys automatically with `make dev-start`
- ðŸ“ˆ **Complete operator testing enabled** locally
- ðŸš€ **Full end-to-end development workflow** now available

## Files Changed

- `components/scripts/local-dev/manifests/backend-service-alias.yaml` - NEW: Service alias for backend connection
- `components/scripts/local-dev/manifests/operator-deployment.yaml` - Added BACKEND_API_URL env var
- `components/scripts/local-dev/crc-start.sh` - Integrated service alias into deployment flow
- `components/scripts/local-dev/README.md` - Updated docs with operator integration details
- `README.md` - Added local development quick start highlighting the fix
- `CHANGELOG.md` - NEW: Documented the bug fix and operator integration

## Verification Steps

1. Run `make dev-start` (deploys fix automatically)
2. Run `make dev-test` (should show 24/24 passing)
3. Create test AgenticSession - should complete successfully
4. Check job logs - no backend connection errors
